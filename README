dgfConfig
==========
(c)2012-2013 by Philipp Scholz (pscholz@ikp.uni-koeln.de)

This program was originally developed in the scope of the developement of the xiaStarter program. It is a program to adjust the parameters of the DGF-4C modul files within the matter of the Miniball Acquisition Code by Nigel Warr. Now this is a standalone version which should provide a better UI and many other features in comparison to the dgfConfig-Widget of the Miniball Code.

STANDARD STRUCTURE:
	- *.cpp files are in ./src
	- *.o files in ./obj
	- moc_* files in ./moc
	- ui_* files in ./ui

DEPENDENCIES:
The user will have to have the Qt-project framework of version greater than 4.6.2 and lower than 5.0.  If this is not the case, the specific line should be edited within the dgfConfig.pro file.

INSTALL:
In Order to get the dgfConfig program running one has to use the qmake program of the Qt framework. "qmake dgfConfig.pro" should create a Makefile in the main directory. Afterwards one can simply run "make".
